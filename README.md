# Task 1 ( Odd or Even Number Checker )
- The program asks the user to input a number.
- It checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator %.
- If divisible, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

# Task 2 ( Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop )
- A variable a is initialized to 0.
- The program loops through numbers 1 to 50 using range(1, 51).
- Each number is added to a.
- Finally, the result is printed.
